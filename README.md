# FirstBoost
This is a sample project that I was going to use to illustrate how one might structure a cuda runtime app built with cmake, tested with google test, that might just happen to use boost.

I might still do it... but wanted to get something out on github so i could work on it while my kid is using the machine with the gpu in it.

## build & test

Do an out-of-source build to a directory called 'build' then run the tests

```
cmake -S . -B build
cd build
make
```
